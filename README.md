I once built this music player app from my knowledge of Java Android development.

It's now an abandoned side project I started over a year ago.

I left it 90% completed, just got too busy to finish it, or maybe I got what I wanted. ðŸ˜‰

I actually wanted a personalized music player app with features I'd like in any music player app.

And I made it...

While working on this project, I learned about the Android File System and how the Android team is so serious about user data security with the implementation of the Storage framework, which requires user permission for access to folders and subdirectories.

My interaction with user-generated files in this app was done using the Android MediaStore content provider.

I also learned about multithreading, how to run background tasks, and how to separate non-UI based operations from the main thread.

The app was built implementing the MVC software architecture. It solidified my understanding of OOP. I also gained a lot of data structure and algorithm experience while coding this to life.
